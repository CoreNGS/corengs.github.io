                <p><span class="mx-5"></span>Welcome to the core of NGS, an operating system base solving the core issues that affects the current operating system market. CoreNGS is a development aiming to create a core for a new generation of software. New Generation Systems (NGS's) are any operating using CoreNGS's operating system base to benefit anything, whether that'd be a product, an organization, a personal/professional project, or anything/anyone else.</p><br>
                <p><span class="mx-5"></span>CoreNGS solves five core failures many operating systems trying to compete with Windows, ChromeOS, or MacOS face, without really knowing it. You can read the descriptions of the five failures we have noticed in other operating systems similar to CoreNGS, but if you wish to know more on how we are fixing those issues, read our <a class="brand" href="about">about page</a>.</p><br>
                <p><span class="mx-5"></span>Is CoreNGS ready for production? No. Our <a class="brand" href="people">development team</a> is small, and without many resources required to build the system as it should be. We still plan to work on this, but understand that extreme time/emotional/physical/mental strain is a factor for us to worry about. We still do this because we sincirely believe in our projects. CoreNGS is always open to volunteers.</p><br>
                <p><span class="mx-5"></span>Where can I donate to help CoreNGS? The Potabi Foundation has an <a class="brand" href="https://opencollective.com/potabifoundation">OpenCollective page</a> in which funds from there supports our project. The <a class="brand" href="https://patreon.com/potabi">Potabu Systems Patreon Page</a> will also support us, as funds from there go to supporting the Potabi Systems project, which in the long-term relies on the development of CoreNGS. We appriciate every single donation, as even a dollar a month can give us strong ability to do so much more with these projects.</p><br>
